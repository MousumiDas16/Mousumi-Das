    <p>I am <b>Mousumi Das</b>, a twenty-nine years old female and a Junior at the Oakland University. I was born in Gopalganj, a small town in Bangladesh, a south-Asian country. I have started as a transfer student majoring in Information System Technology from Fall 2019. Although, I may be older than most of my classmates, I sincerely believe that a person is never too old to go to school. I started my journey seeking a college degree in the Shelton State community college in Fall 2012 in Alabama.  I finished an Associate degree in May 2015 majoring in General studies. Notable courses that I took for my associates include Office applications, Web programming, Business communication, Economics, Business Precalculus, HTML, and C++ programming. Among those courses, I particularly enjoyed IT and programming related courses. Therefore, I chose IT as my major for my bachelor's degree. I joined Southern Illinois University Carbondale (SIUC) in Fall 2016 to complete my bachelor's degree. I finished three semesters at SIUC before moving to Rochester Hills, Michigan due to an unavoidable circumstance.</p>

<p>I am a tech-savvy woman. I am proficient in various technologies and platforms. I have owned and used various state-of-the-art devices such as iPhone, iPod, iPad, MacBook, Surface laptop, iWatch, and a Google Nexus phone. Among those iPhones are my all-time favorite devices. The list of operating systems that I am proficient at include: iOS, Mac, Windows, Ubuntu, and Android. I can write computer programs in C++, Java, Web system programming and HTML. Among the office application suites, I am proficient in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Access. </p>

<p>I also have significant work experiences which include working as a Sales associate in Target Mobile in 2015, working as a Teller at the Regions Bank in 2016, and working as a Sales Associate in Skyland Discount Store in 2014. My responsibilities in Target Mobile included selling wireless plans and facilitating connection activations, answering customer queries and demoing cell phones. On the other hand, my responsibilities at the Region Bank include: processing transactions, answering customer queries, suggesting products based on customers' needs and preferences and explaining bank policies and guidelines. </p>  

<p>I am a fluent reader and writer of both English and Bengali. Besides that, I can communicate fluently in Hindi as well. My favorite hobby is singing. I love to sing and listen to music. I listen to songs belonging to various genres sung in either English, Hindi, or Bengali. I probably can sing or listen to music all day long. Another of my favorite hobbies is travelling. Notable places from the USA that I have visited include Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Orlando, Miami, Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, New York City, Panama City, Pensacola, Atlanta, Chicago, Smokey Mountains, Ruby Falls, Yellowstone National park. Among the international destinations, I have travelled India, France, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, UAE, and Brazil. I also like to watch movies. I have 3 pet birds --two girls and one boy parakeets. I adore them so much. I have 3 orchid plants that I take care of regularly.</p>
